#DevDocs.io Wrapper
This is a simple chrome app that just wraps the devdocs.io website into a desktop application, it uses the webview tag and i made a custom icon for it.

# Installing
To install this app type chrome://extensions into the address bar of chrome and press the `load unpacked extension...` button, and select this folder, the app should now be listed on your chrome app launcher.
